This boilerplate is here to give you a starting point for your angular-meteor projects. Essential atmosphere packages are included to give you features like roles and collection schemas out-of-the-box.

## Motivation

I really love Meteor for at least <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/sevenprinciples">seven reasons</a>. However, I'm not in love with <a href="https://www.meteor.com/blaze">Blaze</a> just yet. Blaze is still very young. The documentation is lackluster, spacebars just doesn't cut it against robust frameworks like Angular, and there aren't many great UI packages just yet (like a ui-bootstrap for spacebars). All of this will come in time, but in the meantime, there's <a href="http://angularjs.meteor.com/">angular-meteor</a>! In fact, angluar-meteor incorporates both <a href="http://angularjs.meteor.com/manifest">Angular and Blaze</a> so you can slowly migrate to Blaze, or slowly migrate to Angular, or use both together forever â™¥.

## Installation

1. Clone the project <code>git clone https://github.com/srtucker22/angular-meteor-boilerplate.git</code>
2. Go to the primary directory <code>cd angular-meteor-boilerplate</code>
3. Run meteor to get all the packages <code>meteor</code>
4. Add a settings.json to the primary directory <code>touch settings.json</code>
5. Add your personal settings for the following services included in meteor-cryptogram (or remove the ones you don't want)

        ```
        {
          "facebook" : {
            "appId": "YOUR_APP_ID",
            "secret": "YOUR_APP_SECRET"
          },
          "kadira": { 
            "appId": "YOUR_APP_ID", 
            "appSecret": "YOUR_APP_SECRET" 
          },
          "papertrail" : {
            "port" : YOUR_PORT_NUMBER
          }
        }
        ```

6. run the app with the settings <code>meteor --settings settings.json</code>
7. enjoy!

### Adding allow rules for external URLs

The [browser-policy](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/browser-policy) adds rules to deny all operations from external URLs.
This helps dealing with clickjacking and other XSS methods used to attack the client. To whitelist a url, add following to 
__server/config/security.js__

```javascript
BrowserPolicy.content.allowOriginForAll(YOUR_URL);
```

Other security enforcing packages like [audit-argument-checks](https://docs.meteor.com/#/full/auditargumentchecks) and 
[matteodem:easy-security](https://github.com/matteodem/meteor-easy-security) have also been added.
